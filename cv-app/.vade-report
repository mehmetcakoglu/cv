# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation

Successfully implemented Vercel Speed Insights for the Vue 3 + Vite CV application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed Package
- Added `@vercel/speed-insights` version 1.3.1 to the project dependencies
- Updated `package.json` and `package-lock.json` with the new dependency

### 2. Integrated SpeedInsights Component
- Modified `src/App.vue` to import the `SpeedInsights` component from `@vercel/speed-insights/vue`
- Added the `<SpeedInsights />` component to the template, placing it alongside the existing `<Analytics />` component

### Files Modified
- **package.json** - Added `@vercel/speed-insights` dependency
- **package-lock.json** - Updated with new package and its dependencies
- **src/App.vue** - Added SpeedInsights import and component

## Implementation Details

Following the Vercel Speed Insights documentation for Vue applications, the SpeedInsights component was added to the root App component. This ensures that Speed Insights will track performance metrics across all routes and pages of the application.

The implementation follows the Vue framework-specific instructions:
- Imported `SpeedInsights` from `@vercel/speed-insights/vue`
- Added the component in the template at the root level

## Verification

The implementation was verified by:
1. Successfully installing the package via npm
2. Building the project with `npm run build` - build completed successfully with no errors
3. Confirming all changes are properly tracked in git

## Next Steps

After deployment to Vercel:
1. Enable Speed Insights in the Vercel dashboard for this project
2. The tracking script will be available at `/_vercel/speed-insights/script.js`
3. Performance metrics will start being collected after deployment
4. View data in the Speed Insights tab of the Vercel dashboard

The application is now ready to track real-world performance metrics including Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) and other speed-related metrics once deployed to Vercel.
