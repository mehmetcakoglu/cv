# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

Successfully implemented Vercel Web Analytics for the Vue 3 + Vite CV application.

## Changes Made

### Modified Files:

1. **src/App.vue**
   - Added import for `Analytics` component from `@vercel/analytics/vue`
   - Added `<Analytics />` component to the template at the top level
   - This enables automatic tracking of page views and visitor analytics

2. **package.json**
   - Added `@vercel/analytics` v1.6.1 to dependencies

3. **package-lock.json**
   - Updated lockfile with new dependency tree for @vercel/analytics

## Implementation Details

Following the official Vercel Web Analytics documentation for Vue.js applications:
- Installed the `@vercel/analytics` package using npm
- Imported the Analytics component from `@vercel/analytics/vue` in App.vue
- Added the `<Analytics />` component at the top of the template section
- The component automatically enables route tracking when using vue-router (which is already installed in this project)

## Verification

- Build completed successfully with `npm run build`
- TypeScript compilation passed without errors
- Production bundle generated correctly (232.13 kB gzipped)
- All existing functionality preserved

## Next Steps for Deployment

Once deployed to Vercel:
1. Enable Web Analytics in the Vercel dashboard for this project
2. Visit the Analytics tab in the project settings
3. After deployment, verify the analytics tracking is working by checking for network requests to `/_vercel/insights/view` in the browser's Network tab
4. Wait a few days for data to accumulate to see visitor analytics and page view metrics

## Technical Notes

- The Analytics component is framework-aware and will automatically track route changes in Vue applications
- No additional configuration is required for basic analytics tracking
- The component is lightweight and won't impact the application's performance
- Privacy-compliant and GDPR-ready analytics solution
